- da_url: https://johnlearningsomesxit.github.io/josh-resume/?role=da

## Delivered

- Rebuilt the corrupted page as clean UTF-8 HTML.
- Added an accessible AI PM / Data Analyst role switch.
- Added direct links using `?role=ai-pm` and `?role=da`.
- Kept shared employment facts consistent while changing the professional
  emphasis, skill ordering, experience bullets, project selection, and contact
  message.
- Added a Data Analyst presentation focused on SQL, Hive, Oracle SQL,
  PostgreSQL, Airflow, Google Apps Script, reporting automation, data quality,
  and operational analytics.
- Preserved the existing resume PDF, contact links, background asset, and
  static GitHub Pages-compatible architecture.

## Evidence Boundary

The Data Analyst version does not claim a separate historical DA job title.
It presents verified data responsibilities and outcomes from the existing
resume under a DA-oriented narrative.
